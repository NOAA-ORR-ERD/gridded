An example of how to load a non-compliant unstructured grid file

NOTE: This example works for loading a gridded dataset from
      an arbitrary text file. You should be able to work with
      it once loaded.

But Saving it back out as a conforming file is broken:

We need a "proper" way to save a full dataset. Currently the code can save a UGRId, but the rest of teh
dataset info is lost. i.e. it can't find use the time variable. or it's coordinates.

This example uses a data file available in this gitHub repo:

https://github.com/erdc/AdhModel

You should be able to directly download it from:

https://github.com/erdc/AdhModel/blob/master/tests/test_files/SanDiego/SanDiego.nc
